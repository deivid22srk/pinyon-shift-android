- [x] On native render, the main screen is completely green (fixed fa5079d)
  - Not native: byte-identical with native off. Caused by
    `--pinyon_shift_skip_opening_movies=true`: the skip hook
    (`PinyonShiftCompleteOpeningMovie`, 0x82E5D8AC) ends *every* XMedia movie,
    including the title loop `media/ui/videos/PressStart.wmv`, so its YUV
    planes stay zero (RGB 0,77,0). With movies playing the title is correct.
    Fix idea: only skip `media/ui/videos/splash_intros/*.wmv`.
- [x] Native render not working, defaulting to Xenos (obsolete)
  - The Xenos renderer and the renderer choice were removed (`e5dc399`,
    `83e5312`); the native executor is the only renderer. The old opt-in
    flags and the SNR03 vegetation fallback no longer exist. The route
    matrix (`fh1-fmv`, `fh1-opening-sync`, `fh1-rewind-sync`,
    `fh1-race-sync`, `fh1-modes-sync`, `fh1-buy-car`) passes natively with
    zero pack misses and zero executor skips.
- [x] (fixed fa5079d) When going back to title screen on native render, the "Single Player" select screen is completely corrupted in texture super pink noisy
  - Same root cause as the green title (movie skip): stale data in the
    PressStart.wmv planes. Identical in compat-only runs; clean with movies on.
- [ ] The intro video intermittently shows black frames while the audio keeps playing (build 37; retention fix in the SDK pinned by this branch, pending on-device validation)
  - The FMV YUV planes are snapshotted from guest memory by the video plane
    fast path while the software decoder is still rewriting them top to
    bottom under CPU contention; the game composites the partial plane, which
    presents as a noise strip on top of a black body. The pinned SDK probes
    every fast-path snapshot and retains the last complete frame on the
    texture until a complete one arrives, so a starved decoder freezes on the
    last good frame instead of flashing black (letterboxed videos never
    freeze: a texture that never held a complete frame still refreshes
    best-effort). The first seconds of the very first video can still be
    black while the runtime translates shaders (no on-device shader pack
    yet); `fh1_fmv_debug = true` logs the snapshot completeness to tell the
    two cases apart.
- [ ] Car selection on an event has either pink correupted textures or mangled car textures/models
  - Not a texture decode bug. The cards are the profile's
    `Thumbnails/Thumbnail_N.xdc` files, which the game renders, resolves and
    compresses from guest memory when it saves a car. Builds before SDK
    `0bf0658` never copied that resolve back into guest memory, so the files
    hold stale memory: the stripes (XR-04 in
    docs/native-renderer/XENOS_RETIREMENT_BACKLOG.md). New cards are correct
    (about 34 KB each); cards saved by older builds stay striped (275-845 KB
    of compressed noise) until the game saves them again. Repairing those is
    NP-0.6 in docs/NATIVE_PORT_BACKLOG.md.
